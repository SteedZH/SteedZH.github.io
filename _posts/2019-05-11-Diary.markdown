# Records  <br>
Yesterday I finish some functions in listview(Student_main, tutor_main). Click the listview then get the view and find children of the view. The component should be assigned then setText(like TextView), which costing much time, so just record it. I am more familiar with the listView adapter and some data structures.   <br>

I also read bipartite graph maximum problem and Max flow. The Edmondâ€”Karp algorithm, s, t and so on.

Busy...
